### Wassup :metal:

My name is Bernardo Duarte and I'm from Brazil. Right now, I'm just starting to show what I know about this world of lines of recipe to... make cakes, I think ðŸ¤”.

Iâ€™m currently working on some personal projects in different languages so that I get to know the basics of everything, then I'll specialize in some technology. Iâ€™m currently learning how to use MongoDB, NodeJS with some libraries, React/React Native, Vue.JS, maybe some PyTorch/TensorFlow later, C# for Unity and so on...

In my free time I love playing games (:video_game:). I prefer First Person Shooters (:gun:) but right now I'm training on some Real-Time Strategy (:crossed_flags:) like Warcraft III, StarCraft II and some Civilization VI, the last one isn't a RTS btw :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:.
