### Wassup :metal:

My name is Bernardo Duarte, I love technology and playing games (:video_game:): I prefer FPS (:gun:) but I have fun playing any genre. Usually, my nickname is BernardoSoD.

Right now I'm working on a game in Unity. Maybe in 3 months I release it for mobile Androids. I'm starting to code for Screeps game as well.
