### Wassup :metal:

My name is Bernardo Duarte, I love technology and playing games (:video_game:): I prefer FPS (:gun:) but I have fun playing any genre. Usually, my nickname is BernardoSoD.

Right now I'm just starting to show what I know about this world of lines of recipe to... make cakes, I think ðŸ¤” and Iâ€™m currently learning how to use MongoDB, NodeJS with some libraries, React/React Native, Vue.JS, maybe some PyTorch/TensorFlow later, C# for Unity and so on...
